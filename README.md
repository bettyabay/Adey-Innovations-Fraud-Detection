# Adey-Innovations-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on developing machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions in e-commerce and banking sectors. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, explainability using SHAP and LIME, and deployment using Flask and Docker. The project also includes a Dash-based interactive dashboard for fraud analysis.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, merging datasets, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP, CNN, RNN, and LSTM.
Model Explainability: SHAP and LIME for interpretability.
Deployment: Flask API for real-time fraud detection, Docker containerization.
Visualization: Dash-powered interactive dashboard for fraud insights.
